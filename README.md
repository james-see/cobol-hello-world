# cobol-hello-world
Yep, I am learning cobol, because dead languages are never really dead.

## quickstart

### OSX

`brew install gnu-cobol` because `open-cobol` is not maintained anymore or something

then run `cobl ./helloworld-sh` and it should print out the magic to the terminal

to compile helloworld yourself run `cobl -x -o helloworld-sh helloworld`

enjoy.
